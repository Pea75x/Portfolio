      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Junior Developer with a background in events including organising
        engineering exhibitions. <br />
        Once the pandemic hit, I took up coding with SheCodes and found I really
        enjoyed it! After going back to work in events, I found that I wasn‚Äôt as
        motivated anymore, and missed the thrill you get when finally solving
        the juicy problems you‚Äôve been working on. <br />
        This is when I decided to take up Software Engineering with General
        Assembly, and start my career as a Software Developer.

          <h3>Festival App</h3>
          <h4>10 days | solo project</h4>
          <img />
          <p>
            The brief was to build a full stack application using a Python
            Django API and consuming our API with a separate front end using
            React. I was most proud of the messaging function between users.

          <h4>1 week | 3 person project</h4>
          <img />
          <p>
            Together with my team we created an API of places to visit in London
            using MongoDB. We then created the front end using React and Bulma.
            The main tasks I was responsible for were the search page, adding
            and removing user likes and itinerary, the itinerary page, the place
            cards, and making sure certain parts of the page were only visible
            to those logged in/admin. We got a chance to create forms and use
            authentication.

          <h3>Harry Potter site</h3>
          <h4>2 days | Pair project</h4>

          <p>
            In this pair coded project we created a React front end website and
            game using a Harry Potter API. I created most of the CSS such as the
            backgrounds and created the game. I also added the sorting function
            using local storage and created the cards.

          <h3>Pirate Pete‚Äôs Jungle game</h3>
          <h4>1 week | Solo project</h4>
          <p>
            Using JavaScript I created a pirate game which involves moving
            around the board, avoiding characters and collecting points. This
            involved collision detection, set intervals and basic animation, as
            well as a lot of fun CSS!

            Since my time at MA I have worked on many different exhibitions and

            creating and running webinars using Bigmarker and creating virtual
            awards using Evessio.
